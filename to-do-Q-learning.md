# TODO for Q-learning

* check with yujie the format of plot

* try with different set of n_star value instead of [1, 100, 10000, 20000, 40000] (maybe discuss with yujie)

* double check the result of decresing exploration (escpecially M_opt)

* M_opt of learning by self-practice seems viberating a lot

* choose a good q-learning agent. Now the visualization of q_table doesn't make sense in two of the three states.
